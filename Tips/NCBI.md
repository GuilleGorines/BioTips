If you wanted to download several GenBank objects (sequences), [Batch Entrez](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/batchentrez) can help, follow these steps:

1. Create a file with all the ids you wish to download. For instance, these monkeypox sequences:
   ```
    AY603973.1
    AY741551.1
    AY753185.1
    MN346701.1
    MN346702.1
   ```
2. Go to the [Batch Entrez Website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/batchentrez), upload the file and press `retrieve`.
3. The website will find the database entries for you, and will display how many of them have been found.
4. Then, you will be given the results of this query, in a list format.
5. If you wanted, for instance, to download all the entries in fasta format, you can do so in the lower section. Press `summary` and choose the option that best suites your needs.
